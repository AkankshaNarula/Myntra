# MYNTRAVERSE
Can fast fashion truly be fast, fashionable, and friendly? Gen Z craves unique style but faces a fashion paradox: endless choices, endless returns. How can we revolutionise the shopping experience by offering personalised style recommendations and **addictive engagement**?
**Fashion apps are influencer-driven**, showcasing numerous styles that can overwhelm consumers. 

The current fashion landscape, especially in digital spaces, faces several challenges:

**Influencer homogeneity:** Many fashion influencers tend to promote similar styles, often driven by sponsorships and trends. This results in a lack of diversity in fashion recommendations.

**Lack of genuine individuality:** There's a growing desire for more authentic and unique fashion choices that aren't just echoes of mainstream influencer culture.

**Need for crowd-sourced fashion inspiration:** There's an opportunity to harness the creativity and diversity of everyday people's style choices, rather than relying solely on professional influencers.

**Desire for interactive fashion experiences:** People want more engaging ways to explore and experiment with fashion, beyond just scrolling through static images or videos.

There’s a thirst for dressing up, yet there isn’t even a fashion games section
**Despite a clear interest in fashion and dressing up, there's a noticeable absence of engaging, game-like experiences in the fashion app world.**
